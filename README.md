The variables that are statistically significant are the vehicle length and the ground clearance. The p values of the two variables were well below the .05 accepted p value. The slope of the linear model is essentially zero with how low the value is. The linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes to a 71% effectiveness. The .714 r-squared value is a strong linear relationship, even if it is not the most telling number to support the data. Nonetheless, .714 is considered a strong relationship to effectively grade the linear model.
